# RipsNet: a general architecture for fast and robust estimation of the persistent homology of point clouds

This repository contains the code asscoiated to [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01725) arXiv article.

- *tutorial.ipynb* is a jupyter-notebook to run a small version of our experiments on a synthetic data set.
It has been tested with Tensorflow version 2.5.0.
- *expes_synth_ucr.zip* contains code and instructions for reproducing the full experiments on synthetic and UCR time series data sets.
- *expes_3Dshape.zip* contains code and instructions for reproducing the full experiments on 3D shape data sets.
